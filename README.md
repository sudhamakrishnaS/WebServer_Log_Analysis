📊 Web Server Log Analysis – Python & Power BI Project

📝 Overview
This project involves analyzing the Calgary HTTP dataset, which contains approximately one year's worth of HTTP requests to the University of Calgary's Computer Science web server. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from real-world web server log data using Python and visualize those insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📁 Dataset Information
The dataset includes detailed HTTP request logs such as:
IP addresses
Timestamps
Requested URLs
HTTP methods and status codes
User agents

These logs provide a rich source of information for understanding web traffic patterns, user behavior, and server performance.

🧠 Analysis Objectives
Parse and clean raw HTTP log data
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Identify traffic trends and peak usage times
Analyze request types and status code distributions
Detect anomalies and unusual access patterns

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3 for data processing and analysis
Pandas, Regex, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Power BI for interactive data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for documenting the analysis workflow
📊 Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI report is included to visually explore the findings from the log analysis. Key features of the dashboard include:

Daily and hourly traffic trends
Top requested resources and file types
HTTP status code breakdown
Most active IP addresses and user agents
Anomaly detection in traffic patterns
📁 The Power BI report (.pbix) is located in the /reports directory.
